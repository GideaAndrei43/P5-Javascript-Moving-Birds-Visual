# Flocking Birds – WebGL Visualization (p5.js)

This project is an experimental 3D visualization built with **p5.js (WebGL)**.  
It explores spatial composition, transparency, and motion through a large set of textured planes (“birds”) moving within a bounded volume.  
A secondary visual structure is formed by a dense field of radiating lines originating from the scene’s center.

The work combines generative motion, randomness, and camera interaction to create a continuously shifting abstract environment.
